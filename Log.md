# Learning Log

## 2019 - No dates (chronological)



### Mode SQL tutorial
Format: Interative website/tutorial

Notes: More extensive tutorials on SQL use. Much more difficult/numerous operations in a single practice problem, and more varied problems and datasets available. Excellent practice problems. More extensive uses of Case and Order/Group functions. Noted that more complex SQL queries are easier when the columns names and head(10) is available for reference.

Would recommend both Mode and SQL, with Mode completed second to reinforce concepts.

### SQLzoo
Format: Interactive website/tutorial

Notes: Basic use of sql (select, nested select, arithametic operations, join, null). Good resources to start with.

### Envisioning Information - Edward R Tufte
Format: Book

Notes: Beautiful book on infographics design. Heavily influenced by Japanese design cues. Critical takeaways: macro and micro data should be integrated, respect 2D "flatspace", use of grey and unsaturated color palettes with strategic use of red to highlight, elimination of lines in tables, selection of font/case is important, designed correctly detail should be included.

### Analysis of Airbnb market for vancouver
Format: Project

Notes: To cement the skills learned in edX DSE200x, I completed a project to analyze the Airbnb market in Vancouver, Canada. Used ML more extensively to do feature analysis and determine causes of overfitting model. Learned Seaborn basics for visualizations.

### Python for Data Science - edX.org DSE200x
Format: MOOC

Notes: Excellent course, learned basics of series and dataframe objects, Jupyter notebooks, basic visualizations within python, and a few basics of ML (techniques, types, supervised vs unsupervised learning, scoring). Lectures were OK, most value came from example notebooks and working through problems. For future MOOCs, consider reading the transcript of leactures to save time. The structure helped shape the learning curve. Final project: Analysis of Canadian Federal election candidates for non-political features.

### Think Python (Orielly)
Format: Book

Review of prior work learning Python using MOOC. Overall good, some typos in examples which can be frustrating.

### Doing Data Science (Orielly)
Format: Book

Notes: Basics of data science, focus on soft skills. Very helpful to undestand the areas to focus on and the general methodology. Heavy emphasis on intial data exploration and framing of business-oriented questions. Algorithm vs model. Causality vs correlation.

### IASSC Six Sigma Green Belt
Format: 40 hr in-person course, online examination with certification.

Notes: Foundational statistical techniques and methods, as well as understanding of different distributions and data features. Population vs sample, determination of n required, confidence intervals and P-valuee, construction and use of control charts. Lean methodology in manufacturing and service settings.

## 2018 and Earlier

### Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science - edX.org MITx 6.00.2x
Format: MOOC

Notes: Continuation of the MITx 6.00.1x course below, continuing to build more complex object oriented programs.

### Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python - edX.org MITx 6.00.1x
Format: MOOC

Notes: Introduction to computer science and object oriented programming. Good background for someone with little exposure to core CS concepts (binary, memory, bit encoding, loops, conditionals, algorithmic complexity, etc).
