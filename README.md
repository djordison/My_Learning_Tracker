Completion of personal project on canadian CPI vs wages vs individual costs complete. Committed to Github.

Technical skills:

Learned additional functionality of Seaborn including FacetGrid, and use of dataframe feature to allow for use of 'Hue' within a plot. Installed and learned to use Tabulate for in-notebook reporting. Experienced difficulty with labelling of lines on graphs directly coupled with very busy/non intuative line graphs. Take-away is to limit features to 5-7 items, or use color coding to show 3rd dimensions.

Project findings:

Overall, increase in cost of essential and non essentials has been lower than that of median average wages. The official CPI has seen an incerase in 145% while wages growed 171% over the same period.

Some specific categories have outstripped wage growth: Education and education related expenses, utility bills, gasoline (one $/L basis, does not account for higher incremental fuel efficiency), and tobacco products.

It is not clear from the data how the cost of housing is calculated. In the case of rent, there is a clear direct cost, however the cost of purchased housing is unclear as to the impact of purchase price vs mortgage vs carrying costs. As well, there is no differention across specific geographies in the data available.

Overall the conclusion can be that other than for some specific categories, consumer prices for essential and non-essential goods have increased at a slower rate than median weekly wages, implying a higher effective purchasing power for consumers from 1997 to 2019.
